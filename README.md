## Web Development Contract
This is a boilerplate that can be used for web development contracts. This is a fork of [Eric Lewis' Web Development Contract](https://github.com/ericandrewlewis/web-development-contract) which can be found [here](https://github.com/ericandrewlewis/web-development-contract).

You can use this in your own work, but if you would like to contribute to the discussion by bringing up issues, send those over to [the original](https://github.com/ericandrewlewis/web-development-contract/issues) rather than my fork.
