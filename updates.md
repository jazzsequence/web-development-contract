##Addendum 1
#Ongoing WordPress Updates and Maintenance Scope

**Summary**  
This document serves as the "Development Plan" for regular, ongoing maintenance and updates by the Developer for the Customer's site. The scope may be updated or altered by the Developer and is assumed to be in effect until such time that the Customer requests to terminate the agreement.

##TERMS

1. **WordPress software updates**  Developer agrees to perform regular updates to the WordPress software no fewer than once a month if updates are available.

2. **Wordpress plugin updates** Developer agrees to manage and perform regular updates to any WordPress plugins installed on the Customer's site no fewer than once a month if updates are available. Premium (paid) plugins that do not automatically update may require the Customer to deliver the update file(s) to the Developer and/or keep the premium plugin account active in order to receive updates. The Developer is *not* responsible for updating premium plugins whose license has expired.

3. **Malware scan** Developer agrees to perform a site-wide malware scan once a month or as needed with the Sucuri SiteCheck Malware Scanner. (http://wordpress.org/plugins/sucuri-scanner/) The Sucuri scanner runs simple checks for common issues across the site, but should not be considered a foolproof solution. In the event that the scan finds malicious code or security issues, the Developer will contact the Customer with a quote for malware removal.

4. **Backups** Developer agrees to create a full database and file system backup no fewer than once a month. *This is a failsafe and not a complete backup solution!* Customers are recommended to have their own backup solution in the event of server failure. Many automated services and plugins exist, such as:

- [VaultPress](http://vaultpress.com/)
- [Backup Buddy](http://ithemes.com/purchase/backupbuddy/)

5. **Site configuration and administration** Developer agrees to manage the operations of the site, as needed, and deal with any plugin or software configuration necessary.

6. **Minor code changes and updates** Developer agrees to perform minor code adjustments and "tweaks", as needed. Updates are to be no more than 1 hour total development time. Further updates or changes deemed necessary will require a separate Development Plan.

7. **Payment** Updates and Maintenance will be billed at the standard hourly rate of $75/hour. Invoices will be sent once a month, on the third Thursday of the month.

8. **Stock images** Customer is responsible for any stock photography required for the site. Developer agrees to advise and implement stock imagery as necessary.
